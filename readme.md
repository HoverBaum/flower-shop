# api consuming website

This repo is a simple illustration of a website consuming an API and rendering content utilizing ES6 template literals. To illustrate this we build a flower shop üíê

You will need Node and NPM installed to get going. Apart from that this repo is self contained and able to run locally.

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

Technically uses:

- [tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) as a CSS framework.
- [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to create a simple API.
- [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) to serve the website.
